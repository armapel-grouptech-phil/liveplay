# ===================================================================
# .gitignore for Liveplay Project
# 
# This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
# Its purpose is to enhance security, protect privacy, and keep the 
# repository clean from machine-specific or generated files.
# ===================================================================


# --- SECURITY & SENSITIVE DATA ---
# This is the most critical section for security and anti-hacking.
# It prevents credentials, API keys (like your Supabase keys), and secret 
# tokens from being committed. If these files are exposed, anyone could
# potentially take over services connected to your project.

# Environment variables file. Should contain all secrets.
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local

# Any files containing credentials or private keys.
*.pem
*.key
credentials.json
*.p12
*.pfx

# Files that might contain secret tokens or passwords.
*secret*
*token*
*password*


# --- DEPENDENCIES ---
# Ignore the entire folder where third-party libraries are installed.
# This folder is often huge and should be regenerated locally by each
# developer using `npm install` or `yarn install`. Committing this can 
# also pose a security risk if a dependency has a known vulnerability.

/node_modules


# --- BUILD ARTIFACTS & COMPILED FILES ---
# Ignore folders and files that are generated by a build process.
# These are not source code and will be created when you build the 
# project for deployment.

/dist
/build
/out
/.next


# --- LOG FILES ---
# Log files can contain sensitive user information, IP addresses, session data,
# and detailed error messages that could reveal your application's structure.
# They are also specific to a single run and should not be versioned.

*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-error.log
yarn-debug.log


# --- IDE & EDITOR CONFIGURATION ---
# Ignore configuration files generated by code editors. These are specific
# to a developer's local setup and should not be shared in the repository.

# VSCode
.vscode/*
!.vscode/settings.json
!.vscode/tasks.json
!.vscode/launch.json
!.vscode/extensions.json
*.code-workspace

# JetBrains (WebStorm, etc.)
.idea/

# Sublime Text
*.sublime-project
*.sublime-workspace


# --- OPERATING SYSTEM & CACHE FILES ---
# Ignore system-specific files that have no relevance to the project itself.
# These files are generated automatically by the OS.

# macOS
.DS_Store
.AppleDouble
.LSOverride

# Windows
Thumbs.db
ehthumbs.db
ehthumbs_vista.db
*.stackdump

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.swp
*~


# --- LOCAL CONFIGURATION OVERRIDES ---
# Sometimes you need to override configuration for your local machine without
# changing the main project config.

config.local.js
settings.local.js


# --- COVERAGE & TEST REPORTS ---
# Ignore reports generated from running tests. These are artifacts, not source code.

/coverage
/lcov-report
